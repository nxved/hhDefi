# Staking and Borrowing DApp on CoreDao Testnet

## Overview
This Staking and Borrowing DApp is built on the CoreDao blockchain to facilitate decentralized finance operations such as staking tokens to earn rewards and borrowing tokens against staked assets. The platform ensures transparency, security, and efficiency by leveraging blockchain technology.

## Features

Token Staking: Users can stake their tokens to earn rewards.
Token Borrowing: Users can borrow tokens by staking their existing tokens as collateral.
Dynamic Interest Rates: The borrowing interest rate adjusts dynamically based on the platformâ€™s utilization rate.
Reward Calculation: Users earn rewards based on the amount of tokens staked and the duration of staking.
Role-Based Access Control: Administrators can set interest rates and reward rates.

## Smart Contracts

The DApp interacts with two smart contracts deployed on the Core DAO testnet:

1. **DefiPlatform Contract**: Manages the creation and status of prescriptions.
   - Contract Address: [0x1748A13Af65400808146615A6FBAda941C5eadDF](https://scan.test.btcs.network/address/0x1748A13Af65400808146615A6FBAda941C5eadDF)
